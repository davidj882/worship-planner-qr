Worship Planner QR is a tool for planning worship gatherings, and was developed with volunteer worship leaders in mind (although church staff are welcome to use it). It provides a centralized web-based system for scheduling worship team members, sharing chord charts and lead sheets, and communicating effectively with everyone on your team.

As a volunteer worship leader, it can be a challenge to find the necessary time to plan a time of corporate worship that will really draw people into God's presence. Not to mention making phone calls, distributing music, making copies, etc. This simple web-based solution can reduce the time necessary for taking care of these details, especially if there are multiple worship leaders at your church, allowing you to spend more time with the Lord to prepare for the service.


Worship Planner QR provides the following features, focusing primarily on the musical part of the worship gathering:


  * Store contact information for everyone on your team
  * See at a glance who is available on any given date
  * Maintain a centralized list of songs, with links to downloadable sheet music or lead sheets
  * See an overview of who is scheduled when
  * Send email to everyone scheduled for a given week, at the click of a button
  * See detailed notes about any given Sunday (or Saturday) service
